## Feedback for Jake (wang7367)

Intended for Jake Wang's source code [here](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga).

* You have a few named functions nested inside of your [`init()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L5-L253) method. Specifically, [`isPassed()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L152-L155), [`isQueued()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L159-L165), [`doneTrans()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L169-L171), [`isNotFull()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L174-L176), [`merge()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L180-L190), [`turnDown()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L194-L204), [`turnUp()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L208-L218), [`sortInAscending()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L221-L224), [`sortInDescending()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L227-L230), and [`canBePickedUp()`](https://github.com/wang7367/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/solution.js#L235-L251). I think, defining these as methods in the parent object instead (as you've done with `init()` and `update()` already, leads to more readable, and reusable code. The method invocations would simply become` this.turnDown()`, `this.turnUp()`, etc. If you're unfamiliar about scope in Javascript objects, MDN has some great docs on [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) and [scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope).
* Another recommendation on readability - there are a few nitpicky inconsistencies throughout (indentation, strict equality vs. loose equality, etc) that a linting tool might catch. There are plenty of possibilities out there to choose, and ultimately it's your call. I've personally used [eslint](https://eslint.org/) before, and would suggest that if you're comfortable with the nodeJS ecosystem.
* Regardless of the outcome of your interview - it sounds like the project maintainers are very receptive to community submitted solutions being added via pull request to the [source repo](https://github.com/magwo/elevatorsaga). I think it would be a great way to build your open source reputation, and help other coders become more familiar with your work!

Good luck!
